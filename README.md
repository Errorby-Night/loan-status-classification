# Loan Status Detection Using Multiple Classification Algorithms

This repository contains code for detecting loan status using multiple classification algorithms.

## Introduction

This project aims to predict loan approval status based on various features using several classification algorithms. The dataset used in this project contains information about applicants' demographics and financial details.

## Usage
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Errorby-Night/loan-status-classification
```
```bash
cd loan-status-classification
```
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then just run the ipynb and see the magic happen!

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project (loan_data_1.csv) contains the following columns:

- **Gender**: Gender of the applicant.
- **Married**: Marital status of the applicant.
- **Dependents**: Number of dependents.
- **Education**: Education level of the applicant.
- **Self_Employed**: Self-employment status of the applicant.
- **ApplicantIncome**: Income of the applicant.
- **CoapplicantIncome**: Income of the co-applicant.
- **LoanAmount**: Loan amount requested.
- **Loan_Amount_Term**: Term of the loan.
- **Credit_History**: Credit history of the applicant.
- **Property_Area**: Type of property area.
- **Loan_Status**: Status of the loan approval.
## Results
The code evaluates the performance of the following classification algorithms:

- Support Vector Machine (Linear, Polynomial, RBF, Sigmoid)
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Tree
- Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier
- Naive Bayes
- Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
